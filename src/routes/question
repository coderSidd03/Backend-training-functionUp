Problem 1:

Write a POST /players api that saves a player’s details and doesn’t allow saving the data of a player with a name that already exists in the data


let players =
    [
        {
            "name": "manish",
            "dob": "1/1/1995",
            "gender": "male",
            "city": "jalandhar",
            "sports": ["swimming"]
        },
        {
            "name": "gopal",
            "dob": "1/09/1995",
            "gender": "male",
            "city": "delhi",
            "sports": ["soccer"],
        },
        {
            "name": "lokesh",
            "dob": "1/1/1990",
            "gender": "male",
            "city": "mumbai",
            "sports": ["soccer"],
        },
    ]
